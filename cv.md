## About me

For some time I've worked as a teacher in public school, but right now I'm private tutor for English and programming for kids. I _realy_ love sharing my knowledge. I already tryed to start WebDev path before but things got complicated with personal and health problems. In future I want to learn how to play instruments and create music, how to draw, how to model and sculpt 3d objects and maybe even make videogames with all of that. But that is just for a hobby - right now I'm interested at WebDev: creating beautiful thing and make engaging interactive expirience right in the web browser.
